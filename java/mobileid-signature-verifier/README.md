# mobileid-signature-verifier

A sample implementation how to verify a CMS/PKCS7 signature, i.e. from a Swisscom Mobile ID signature response.
For simplicity, only basic validation is done. You may use the code as a basis to further improve the signature validation.

Note: In order to use this tool as a single (independent) project, it has been moved to its own repository at http://git.io/NF1w.
